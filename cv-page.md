### **A3Data Consulting** - Data Engineer 


SINCE NOVEMBER 2021

I've worked implementing a cloud-based architecture of project. I implemented 
infrastructure as code by using Terraform in AWS. Different AWS services were 
used in this project, data lakes (S3), Kubernetes cluster (EKS), Virtual Private 
Cloud (VPC), Elastic Map-Reduce (EMR) and others. Airflow was used to orchestrate 
the pipeline and argoCD to manage the applications in Kubernetes cluster. The Gitlab 
CI was used to deploy.  

Main technologies used : 

- AWS 
    - EKS
    - EMR
    - EC2
    - S3
    - IAM
- Airflow
- ArgoCD
- Spark
- Terraform
- Gitlab CI
