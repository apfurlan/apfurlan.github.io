Interactions involving non-polar groups are all deemed purely repulsive. We find that the qualitative behavior of excess properties (excess volume, enthalpy, and constant pressure heat capacity) agrees with that found experimentally for alcohols such as t-butanol in water. Moreover, we observe that our simple solute under certain conditions acts as a ‚Äústructure-maker,‚Äù in the sense that the temperature of maximum density of the bulk water model increases as the solute is added, i.e., the anomalous behavior of the solvent is enhanced by the solute.\"\n  //   },\n  //   {\n  //     title: \"Critical points, phase transitions and water-like anomalies for an isotropic two length scale potential with increasing a ttractive well\",\n  //     authors: \"L.
