    I studied physics at  <a href="https://www.fisica.ufpr.br" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Universidade Federal do Paran√°</a>(Curitiba, Brazil), where I developed a 
    strong foundation in theoretical and computational methods. Later, I earned my M.Sc. and Ph.D. 
    degrees from <a href="https://www.if.ufrgs.br/if/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul</a> (Porto Alegre, Brazil), with a collaborative
    research period at the Statistical Mechanics and Condensed Matter Group of the 
    <a href="https://www.iqf.csic.es/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Institute of Physical 
    Chemistry Rocasolano</a> (Madrid, Spain). My doctoral and postdoctoral work focused on statistical 
    mechanics, phase transitions, and complex systems, particularly in lattice gas models and associating 
    fluids. From 2017 to 2021, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Physics Department of 
    <a href="https://www.fisica.ufmg.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais</a> (Belo Horizonte, Brazil), collaborating with Prof. Ronald Dickman.

    Building on my physics research background, I've transitioned into data engineering, 
    progressing from data analysis to technical leadership. My career began developing Power 
    BI dashboards and implementing business rules as a Data Analyst. This evolved into building 
    robust data infrastructure as a Data Engineer, where I configured AWS services (EMR, EKS), 
    automated deployments with Terraform, and orchestrated Spark jobs via Airflow. As a Platform Engineer 
    at Z-Tech/BEES, I designed and managed cloud infrastructure on Azure, developing CI/CD pipelines with 
    Kubernetes and creating data observability systems using Airflow and PySpark. Currently, as Tech Lead 
    at BEES, I lead data platform initiatives including a secure Databricks Delta-sharing solution for 
    partner collaboration and an innovative automation framework integrating Jira with Terraform for 
    infrastructure management. Beyond technical projects, I mentor team members and contribute to technical 
    hiring, fostering team growth while maintaining hands-on involvement in system architecture and 
    implementation.

    My work consistently focuses on creating scalable, automated solutions that bridge business needs with 
    technical execution, applying the same analytical rigor from my academic research to solve complex 
    data challenges.
