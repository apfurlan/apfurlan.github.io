# **About Me**

&nbsp;
&nbsp;




I studied physics at Universidade Federal do Paran√°(Curitiba-PR-Brazil). 
Earned my  M.Sc and Ph.D degrees from Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul 
(Porto Alegre-RS-Brazil) with a collaborative period at Statistical Mechanics and 
Condensed Matter Group of the Institute of Physical Chemistry Rocasolano (Madrid-Spain). 
Between 2017 and 2021, I worked as postdoc at the Physics Department of the 
Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (Belo Horizonte-MG-Brazil), working with Ronald 
Dickman. My publications are available at [Sci. Publications](./phy-pub-page.md).



Currently I have been working with Data Science (DS). I started my DS career as a Data Analyst converting business rules into BI panels. In this period I worked essentially with PowerBI, 
SQL and DAX. Posteriorly I migrated to Data Engineering and it is the position that I'm 
working at this time. As an Data Engineer, I worked with terraform, AWS cloud,
Kubernetes, CI/CD, Airfow, Python, Spark, and other technologies.
