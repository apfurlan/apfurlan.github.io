# **About Me**

I studied physics at Universidade Federal do Paraná(Curitiba-PR-Brazil). Earned my M.Sc and Ph.D degrees from Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (Porto Alegre-RS-Brazil) through the study of the influence of the disorder and solutes in the anomalous behavior of the liquid state. This work was performed under the supervision of Marcia Barbosa and Carlos Fiore, with a doctoral collaborative period at Statistical Mechanics and Condensed Matter Group of the Institute of Physical Chemistry Rocasolano (Madrid-Spain) under the supervision of Enrique Lomba and Noé Almarza.

I'm currently postdoc at the Physics Department of the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (Belo Horizonte-MG-Brazil), working with Ronald Dickman, on the study of the disorder effects in the critical behavior of different lattice gases and also in the Entropic Sampling Monte Carlo Simulations.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

#### Header 4

|:-------------|:------------------|:------|
| ok           | good swedish fish | nice  |
| out of stock | good and plenty   | nice  |
| ok           | good `oreos`      | hmm   |

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
