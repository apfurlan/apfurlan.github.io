# **About Me**

&nbsp;
&nbsp;




I studied physics at Universidade Federal do Paran√°(Curitiba-PR-Brazil). 
Earned my  M.Sc and Ph.D degrees from Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul 
(Porto Alegre-RS-Brazil) with a collaborative period at Statistical Mechanics and 
Condensed Matter Group of the Institute of Physical Chemistry Rocasolano (Madrid-Spain). 
Between 2017 and 2021, I worked as postdoc at the Physics Department of the 
Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (Belo Horizonte-MG-Brazil), working with Ronald 
Dickman. My publications are available at [Sci. Publications](./phy-pub-page.md).



Currently I have been working with Data Science (DS). I started my DS career as a Data Analyst converting business rules into BI panels. In this period I worked essentially with PowerBI, 
SQL and DAX. Posteriorly I migrated to Data Engineering and it is the position that I'm 
working at this time. As an Data Engineer, I worked with terraform, AWS cloud,
Kubernetes, CI/CD, Airfow, Python, Spark, and other technologies.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

#### Header 4

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
